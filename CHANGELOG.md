# Changelog
## :pizza: v0.4.0
  - ### :bulb: Features
    - New function to ``toggle`` an ``Output`` ``Pin`` between high and low.
    - adding a function to lit a connected LED with direct ``unsafe`` peripheral access. This might
    be helpful to produce debug hints in case there is no console output possible.
    - introduce the ``GpioError`` type for functions that return a ``Result`` in this crate
    - Introducing the possibility to register functions/closures to event detections from a GPIO input pin.
    Those functions/closure will execute in the context of the interrupt handler for those events

  - ### :wrench: Maintenance
    - Based on "best practices" the functions for the ``Pin`` that changes their behaviour are renamed
    from ``to_*`` to ``into_*``.
    - the ``ruspiro_pi3`` feature is no longer active by default
    - increase code quality using ``carge fmt`` and ``cargo clippy``
    - move all mmio register definitions into a lowlevel ``interface.rs`` file

  - ### :book: Documentation
    - Update documentation on the new functions and the existing ones.
